## üé® Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Size**: Recommended 200x100px or similar aspect ratio
- **Background**: Transparent or white background preferred
- **Quality**: High resolution, clear logos
- **Style**: Professional, official brand logos

## üí° Tips:
- Use transparent PNG files for best results
- Ensure logos are centered and properly sized
- Test that images display well in the white boxes
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 100KB each)

## üîÑ How It Works:
The images will automatically display in the "Trusted Brand Partners" section on the About page. They will appear in grayscale with reduced brightness and opacity by default. As you scroll down to the section, they will gradually transform with a dramatic effect:

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Images start with grayscale + reduced brightness + 60% opacity + slightly smaller scale
- **Dramatic Transition**: When scrolled into view, images transform to full color + increased brightness + full opacity + normal scale
- **Staggered Animation**: Each brand logo transitions with a 0.2-second delay between them, creating a beautiful cascading effect
- **Pulse Effect**: Each brand item gets a subtle pulse animation with a yellow glow when it comes into view
- **Longer Duration**: 1.5-second transition duration for maximum visibility
- **Scroll-Triggered**: The transition is triggered by scroll position rather than hover, providing a more engaging user experience

The effect is designed to be highly visible and create a memorable impression as users scroll through the brand partners section.
